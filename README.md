# My Karabiner Config

I compiled this from various sources when I was in a role which required me to use a Mac, but I had a "Windows" style keyboard. I can't therefore release it under any license, but I'm sure it was all public sources I consumed.

Each row of the keyboard is as follows (without shift, with shift):

* `\|` `1!` `2"` `3£` `4$` `5%` `6^` `7&` `8*` `9(` `0)` `-_` `=+` (backspace at right end)
* `qW` `wW` `eE` `rR` `tT` `yY` `uU` `iI` `oO` `pP` `[{` `]}` (tab at left end, enter at right end)
* `aA` `sS` `dD` `fF` `gG` `hH` `jJ` `kK` `lL` `;:` `'@` `#±` (caps lock at left end, enter at right end)
* `§|` `zZ` `xX` `cC` `vV` `bB` `nN` `mM` `,<` `.>` `/?` (shift at left end and right end)

Note that the `` ` `` and `~` symbols are missing from this right now. They should be in place of the `§` and `±` respectively. PRs welcome!

In addition, mac keyboard function keys remain as mapped.
On all other keyboards have the "left ctrl" key mapped to the "control" key, the "left windows" key mapped to the "option" and the "left alt" key mapped to the "command" key.
The "right alt gr" key is mapped to the "right option" key, the "right windows" key is mapped to "right command", the "menu" key is mapped to the "application" key (like pressing "left control" and clicking in the text box) and the "right ctrl" key is mapped to the "right control" key (which doesn't exist on the mac keyboard).
